        CV is a tech used to understand images. To computer images are pixels made up of colours red, green and blue.
    Grey scale images are 2 dimensional arrays, each pixel denotes the amount of black scale used in numbers. Where as coloured images made up of 3 dimensional array, also the colour of a pixel is defined by amount of red, green and blue in numbers.
    
        There are factors that can affect image understand such as angles, colour composture and other optical disortions.
  
  Hands on:
    Here we are using Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager to open Ubuntu environment to test code in python.
